   <p><h3 id="aboutheadings">Introduction:</h3>
    I'm Mahesh, a dedicated individual from the serene town of Gutlapadu, Bhimavaram in Andhra Pradesh. It's in this peaceful setting that I not only grew up but also cultivated my deep passion for computer science.

    In 2022, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from B V RAJU Institute of Technology. My academic journey has been marked by a commitment to excellence, including notable achievements such as an 80% score in my Intermediate studies at Sri Chaitanya Junior College and a commendable 77% in my S.S.C from Z. P. High School.
    
    <h3  id="aboutheadings">Technical Expertise:</h3>
    My technical prowess extends to full-stack web development, where I've honed my skills in a range of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Java. I've also laid a strong foundation in SQL and am well-versed in the Microsoft Office Suite.
    
    <h3  id="aboutheadings">Projects:</h3>
    I've translated my passion into tangible projects, such as "TRAVELLIFE," a travel website that offers personalized recommendations based on seasonal preferences. Additionally, I've contributed to "AZcart," an online platform designed to facilitate local shop product deliveries. These projects reflect my dedication and commitment to problem-solving and innovation.

My curiosity knows no bounds, and I'm always eager to explore new opportunities and make meaningful connections.
